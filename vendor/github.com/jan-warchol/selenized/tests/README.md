This directory contains samples of colorized terminal output that I use to
test the look of new versions of Selenized palette and make screenshots.

Some of them are shell scripts producing colorful output, and some are just
text files with color code escape sequences embedded in them (the latter can
be viewed using `less -R` or `cat`).
